## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Data Input
- Loads supply chain data from CSV file
- Processes product information (haircare, skincare, cosmetics)
- Aggregates data by product type

### Step 2: Parameter Setting
- User adjusts parameters via dashboard sidebar:
  - Demand factors (how much demand for each product)
  - Warehouse capacities (Mumbai: 35,000, Kolkata: 30,000)
  - Cost multipliers (transportation, inventory)
  - Optimization weights (cost vs revenue vs utilization)

### Step 3: Optimization Engine
- Creates mathematical model with:
  - **Decision Variables**: How much to produce where
  - **Objective Function**: Minimize cost, maximize profit
  - **Constraints**: Capacity limits, demand requirements
- Solves using linear programming solver

### Step 4: Results Display
- Shows optimal production allocation
- Displays key metrics (cost, revenue, profit)
- Creates visualizations (charts, graphs, tables)
- Provides business insights and recommendations

## 📊 Key Outputs

### Primary Metrics
- **Total Cost**: Complete operational cost
- **Total Production**: Units produced across warehouses
- **Total Revenue**: Income from all products
- **Profit**: Revenue minus costs
- **Utilization**: How much warehouse capacity is used

### Visualizations
- **Bar Charts**: Warehouse utilization percentages
- **Pie Charts**: Product distribution breakdown
- **Cost Charts**: Manufacturing vs transportation vs inventory costs
- **Tables**: Detailed allocation by warehouse and product

### Business Insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential problems
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Compares against industry standards
- **Scenario Analysis**: Tests different business conditions
- **What-if Analysis**: Shows impact of parameter changes

## 🎯 Business Value
