🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Advanced Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard! 

I'm Meryem El Osmani, and I just completed building a comprehensive supply chain optimization toolkit that transforms complex business decisions into actionable insights.

🎯 What I Built:
✅ Interactive web dashboard using Python & Streamlit
✅ 6 different optimization algorithms (Linear Programming, Genetic Algorithm, Monte Carlo Simulation)
✅ Real-time parameter adjustment with instant results
✅ Multi-objective optimization balancing cost, revenue & utilization
✅ Scenario analysis & risk assessment tools
✅ Beautiful data visualizations with Plotly

📊 Key Features:
• Optimizes production allocation across multiple warehouses (Mumbai & Kolkata)
• Handles 3 product categories: Haircare, Skincare & Cosmetics
• Minimizes costs while maximizing profits
• Provides what-if analysis for strategic planning
• Exports detailed optimization reports

💡 The Results:
From my latest optimization run:
• Processed 47,371 units across warehouses
• 59% warehouse utilization efficiency
• Real-time cost-benefit analysis
• Data-driven decision support

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python | Streamlit | PuLP | Plotly | Pandas | NumPy | SciPy | Scikit-learn

This project combines my passion for data science, operations research, and creating practical business solutions. It's amazing how mathematical optimization can solve real-world supply chain challenges!

The interactive dashboard makes complex optimization accessible to non-technical users, democratizing data-driven decision making in supply chain management.

Looking forward to applying these skills in supply chain, logistics, or operations research roles!
